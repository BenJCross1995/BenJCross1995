### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


### A Brief Introduction

I am a 28-year-old Data Specialist from Liverpool who has always had a passion for mathematics and statistics. I began coding in 2020 when I started my MSc which was about 90% coded in R. During this MSc I was introduced to various Machine Learning techniques such as Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest and various deep learning techniques which really opened my eyes to the possibilities with data.

Since then I have completed various projects in R and Python with some of my favourites being; my setlist project in R where I can enter an artist's name and get the songs they've played in their last shows as well as the probability that they will play those songs in the future and my YouTube video creation project in Python where I create entire YouTube videos using AI and Python techniques.
