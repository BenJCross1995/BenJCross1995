# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me ðŸ“Š

I'm a passionate Data Specialist from Liverpool, with a deep-rooted fascination for mathematics and statistics. My journey into coding began in 2020 when I embarked on my MSc adventure, and I found myself immersed in the world of R. During this academic pursuit, I delved into various Machine Learning techniques like Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, and deep learning, which completely transformed my perspective on the power of data.

Since then, I've been on a remarkable coding journey, completing numerous projects in both R and Python. Some of my most cherished projects include:
- **Setlist Wizard in R:** Enter an artist's name, and it magically reveals the songs they've performed in their recent shows, along with the probability of them playing those songs in the future.
- **AI-Powered YouTube Video Creation in Python:** I craft entire YouTube videos using cutting-edge AI and Python techniques.

## Education ðŸŽ“

Here's a snapshot of my academic journey:
- **BSc Mathematics and Statistics:** First Class (Hons)
- **MSc Data Analytics:** Distinction
- **PhD in Computer Science:** (Feb 2023 - Ongoing)
   - Research Focus: "Automatic Authorship Attribution Using Machine Learning"

I'm currently conducting my research at The University of Manchester, exploring the fascinating realm of automatic authorship attribution through machine learning.

## Current Projects ðŸ”­

I'm currently engrossed in a few exciting projects, including:
- **Cluster Analysis of F1 Driver Data:** Unveiling intriguing insights from the world of Formula 1.
- **N-grams Demystified:** Preparing a comprehensive tutorial on n-grams.
- **Quarto Blog Creation:** Stay tuned for my blog showcasing my projects and insights.
- **PhD Research:** Continuously delving deeper into the realms of automatic authorship attribution.
